# Data Visualization Critique Paper 
This is a data visualization critique of a random article from the internet. Took the existing graph and pointed out what can be done better with a new visualization(hand-drawn)

## Old visualization:
The visualization report is from an analytics company ‘YouGov’ on preferred Govt jobs in
India by small town residents. I think the story reveals that more than half of the residents
prefer both State as well as Central govt. jobs. Within that a higher percentage of men than
women (23% vs 16%) are likely to choose Central over State government jobs. Among the
generations, a higher number of millennials (31%) than GenZ (24%) showed interest in the
State government jobs.

## New visualization:

I try to convey in one single graph my approach as it signifies the comparison being told in
story.
My graph does obey the principles of visualization like correct axes, axes titles, legends, title
of the graph, correct labels, showing the totals of each category, color coding the categories
and mentioning in legends, proximity while grouping, correct contrasting color options. I have
added the axes titles with proper markings starting from 0 and added the unit of measurement
for y-axis. The legends are given as per the type of Govt jobs preferred. In the x-axis I have
put a name of main category as ‘Gender’ and ‘Generation’ under which the subgroups are
placed. There is a light colored demarcation to divide the main categories and keep similar
sub-groups closer i.e. men and women belong to Gender.

I have created grouped stacked bar chart. The groups are based on Gender(men, women)
and Generation(GenZ, Millennials). This helps to bring into notice the men vs women bars
and GenZ vs Millennials bars. Also, the graph looks much simpler and does convey the same
moral of the story. The story is mostly focussing on that men prefer Central govt jobs more
than women and Millennials prefer State govt. jobs more than GenZ. I have also omitted the
‘Both’ bars which was showing the totals in original graph. Instead I have stacked all similar
categories and marked with different color the two different jobs within each bar. The bars are
marked with a preferred contrast color of red/blue. Appropriate sectional data labels based
on the number of people taking those jobs are marked as data callout like 23% men under
Central govt category.
This new graph conveys same information with more clarity and because of all the above
improvements I would say this is a better graph.
